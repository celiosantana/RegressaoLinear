This code refers to a prediction model using Linear Regression in Python (sklearn package). 

The problem solved involve a prediciont of how long a shipping will arrive considering how much we pay for that. 
For example, if we buy a product and pay 10.00 US$ for shipping, the product will arrive in 7 days (ficticious example), but if I pat 15.00 US$ how
long will take this shipping?

The historical basis is represent in CSV file (500 rows) and these dataset is used to create the Linear Regression Model.

The code presents comments in portuguese language and the example refers to calculate the shipping to southwest (sudeste) region
